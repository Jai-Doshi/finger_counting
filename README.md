•	The program accurately determines the number of fingers raised in the detected hand.

•	Displays corresponding finger images based on the recognized hand gesture.

•	Demonstrates the application of Computer Vision in recognizing complex hand gestures.

•	Offers potential uses in sign language translation, interactive interfaces, and gaming applications.

•	Provides an innovative and interactive way of interacting with technology through hand gestures.
